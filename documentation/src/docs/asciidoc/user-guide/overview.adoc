== Overview

The goal of this document is to provide comprehensive reference documentation for
programmers writing tests, extension authors, and engine authors as well as build tool
and IDE vendors.

[[overview-what-is-junit-5]]
=== What is JUnit 5?

Unlike previous versions of JUnit, JUnit 5 is composed of several different modules from
three different sub-projects.

**JUnit 5 = _JUnit Platform_ + _JUnit Jupiter_ + _JUnit Vintage_**

The **JUnit Platform** serves as a foundation for <<launcher-api,launching testing
frameworks>> on the JVM. It also defines the `{TestEngine}` API for developing a testing
framework that runs on the platform. Furthermore, the platform provides a
<<running-tests-console-launcher,Console Launcher>> to launch the platform from the
command line and build plugins for <<running-tests-build-gradle,Gradle>> and
<<running-tests-build-maven,Maven>> as well as a
<<running-tests-junit-platform-runner,JUnit 4 based Runner>> for running any `TestEngine`
on the platform.

**JUnit Jupiter** is the combination of the new <<writing-tests,programming model>> and
<<extensions,extension model>> for writing tests and extensions in JUnit 5. The Jupiter
sub-project provides a `TestEngine` for running Jupiter based tests on the platform.

**JUnit Vintage** provides a `TestEngine` for running JUnit 3 and JUnit 4 based tests on
the platform.

[[overview-java-versions]]
=== Supported Java Versions

JUnit 5 requires Java 8 (or higher) at runtime. However, you can still test code that
has been compiled with previous versions of the JDK.


[[overview-getting-help]]
=== Getting Help

Ask JUnit 5 related questions on {StackOverflow} or chat with us on {Gitter}.

[[installation]]
== Installation

Artifacts for final releases and milestones are deployed to Maven Central.

Snapshot artifacts are deployed to Sonatype's {snapshot-repo}[snapshots repository] under
{snapshot-repo}/org/junit/[/org/junit].

=== Dependency Metadata

[[dependency-metadata-junit-platform]]
==== JUnit Platform

* *Group ID*: `org.junit.platform`
* *Version*: `{platform-version}`
* *Artifact IDs*:
  `junit-platform-commons`::
    Internal common library/utilities of JUnit. These utilities are intended solely for usage within
    the JUnit framework itself. _Any usage by external parties is not supported._ Use at your own
    risk!
  `junit-platform-console`::
    Support for discovering and executing tests on the JUnit Platform from the console. See
    <<running-tests-console-launcher>> for details.
  `junit-platform-console-standalone`::
    An executable JAR with all dependencies included is provided at Maven Central under the
    https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/junit/platform/junit-platform-console-standalone[junit-platform-console-standalone]
    directory. See <<running-tests-console-launcher>> for details.
  `junit-platform-engine`::
    Public API for test engines. See <<launcher-api-engines-custom>> for details.
  `junit-platform-gradle-plugin`::
    Support for discovering and executing tests on the JUnit Platform using
    <<running-tests-build-gradle,Gradle>>.
  `junit-platform-launcher`::
    Public API for configuring and launching test plans -- typically used by IDEs and build tools.
    See <<launcher-api>> for details.
  `junit-platform-runner`::
    Runner for executing tests and test suites on the JUnit Platform in a JUnit 4
    environment. See <<running-tests-junit-platform-runner>> for details.
  `junit-platform-suite-api`::
    Annotations for configuring test suites on the JUnit Platform. Supported by the
    <<running-tests-junit-platform-runner,JUnitPlatform runner>> and possibly by third-party
    `TestEngine` implementations.
  `junit-platform-surefire-provider`::
    Support for discovering and executing tests on the JUnit Platform using
    <<running-tests-build-maven,Maven Surefire>>.

[[dependency-metadata-junit-jupiter]]
==== JUnit Jupiter

* *Group ID*: `org.junit.jupiter`
* *Version*: `{jupiter-version}`
* *Artifact IDs*:
  `junit-jupiter-api`::
    JUnit Jupiter API for <<writing-tests,writing tests>> and <<extensions,extensions>>.
  `junit-jupiter-engine`::
    JUnit Jupiter test engine implementation, only required at runtime.
  `junit-jupiter-params`::
    Support for <<writing-tests-parameterized-tests,parameterized tests>> in JUnit Jupiter.
  `junit-jupiter-migrationsupport`::
    Migration support from JUnit 4 to JUnit Jupiter,
    only required for running selected JUnit 4 rules.

[[dependency-metadata-junit-vintage]]
==== JUnit Vintage

* *Group ID*: `org.junit.vintage`
* *Version*: `{vintage-version}`
* *Artifact ID*:
  `junit-vintage-engine`::
    JUnit Vintage test engine implementation that allows to run vintage JUnit tests, i.e. tests
    written in the JUnit 3 or JUnit 4 style, on the new JUnit Platform.

[[dependency-metadata-dependencies]]
==== Dependencies

All of the above artifacts have a dependency in their published Maven POMs on
the following _@API Guardian_ JAR.

* *Group ID*: `org.apiguardian`
* *Artifact ID*: `apiguardian-api`
* *Version*: `{apiguardian-version}`

In addition, most of the above artifacts have a direct or transitive dependency to the
following _OpenTest4J_ JAR.

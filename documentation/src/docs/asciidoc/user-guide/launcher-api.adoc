[[launcher-api]]
=== JUnit Platform Launcher API

One of the prominent goals of JUnit 5 is to make the interface between JUnit and its
programmatic clients – build tools and IDEs – more powerful and stable. The purpose is to
decouple the internals of discovering and executing tests from all the filtering and
configuration that's necessary from the outside.

JUnit 5 introduces the concept of a `Launcher` that can be used to discover, filter, and
execute tests. Moreover, third party test libraries – like Spock, Cucumber, and FitNesse
– can plug into the JUnit Platform's launching infrastructure by providing a custom
`{TestEngine}`.

The launching API is in the `{junit-platform-launcher}` module.

An example consumer of the launching API is the `{ConsoleLauncher}` in the
`{junit-platform-console}` project.

[[launcher-api-discovery]]
==== Discovering Tests

Introducing _test discovery_ as a dedicated feature of the platform itself will
(hopefully) free IDEs and build tools from most of the difficulties they had to go
through to identify test classes and test methods in the past.

Usage Example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{testDir}/example/UsingTheLauncherDemo.java[tags=imports]
----

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{testDir}/example/UsingTheLauncherDemo.java[tags=discovery]
----

There's currently the possibility to select classes, methods, and all classes in a
package or even search for all tests in the classpath. Discovery takes place across all
participating test engines.

The resulting `TestPlan` is a hierarchical (and read-only) description of all engines,
classes, and test methods that fit the `LauncherDiscoveryRequest`. The client can
traverse the tree, retrieve details about a node, and get a link to the original source
(like class, method, or file position). Every node in the test plan has a _unique ID_
that can be used to invoke a particular test or group of tests.

[[launcher-api-execution]]
==== Executing Tests

To execute tests, clients can use the same `LauncherDiscoveryRequest` as in the discovery
phase or create a new request. Test progress and reporting can be achieved by registering
one or more `{TestExecutionListener}` implementations with the `Launcher` as in the
following example.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{testDir}/example/UsingTheLauncherDemo.java[tags=execution]
----

There is no return value for the `execute()` method, but you can easily use a listener to
aggregate the final results in an object of your own. For an example see the
`{SummaryGeneratingListener}`.

[[launcher-api-engines-custom]]
==== Plugging in Your Own Test Engine

JUnit currently provides two `{TestEngine}` implementations out of the box:

* `{junit-jupiter-engine}`: The core of JUnit Jupiter.
* `{junit-vintage-engine}`: A thin layer on top of JUnit 4 to allow running _vintage_
  tests with the launcher infrastructure.

Third parties may also contribute their own `TestEngine` by implementing the interfaces
in the {junit-platform-engine} module and _registering_ their engine. Engine registration
is currently supported via Java's `java.util.ServiceLoader` mechanism. For example, the
`junit-jupiter-engine` module registers its `org.junit.jupiter.engine.JupiterTestEngine`
in a file named `org.junit.platform.engine.TestEngine` within the `/META-INF/services` in
the `junit-jupiter-engine` JAR.

[[launcher-api-listeners-custom]]
==== Plugging in Your Own Test Execution Listeners

In addition to the public `{Launcher}` API method for registering test execution
listeners programmatically, custom `{TestExecutionListener}` implementations discovered
at runtime via Java's `java.util.ServiceLoader` facility are automatically registered
with the `DefaultLauncher`. For example, an `example.TestInfoPrinter` class
implementing `{TestExecutionListener}` and declared within the
`/META-INF/services/org.junit.platform.launcher.TestExecutionListener` file is loaded
and registered automatically.

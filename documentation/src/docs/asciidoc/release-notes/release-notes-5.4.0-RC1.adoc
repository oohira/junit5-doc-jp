[[release-notes-5.4.0-RC1-overall-improvements]]
=== Overall Improvements

* A regression introduced in version 5.4.0-M1 of the `junit-bom` has been fixed:
  `<scope/>` elements are omitted from the `<dependency/>` elements again.


[[release-notes-5.4.0-RC1-junit-platform]]
=== JUnit Platform

==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* `TestPlan.add(TestIdentifier)` has always been considered _internal_ and is now
  _deprecated_. While calls from third-party code will continue to work for the time
  being, IDEs and build tools should remove any such code as soon as possible.

==== New Features and Improvements

* The `Launcher` API now provides an `execute(TestPlan, TestExecutionListener...)`
  method that allows one to execute a previously discovered `TestPlan`.
* `@RunWith(JUnitPlatform.class)` no longer executes test discovery twice.
* The root cause and suppressed exceptions are now included in the stack trace printed by
  the `ConsoleLauncher`.
* The `ConsoleLauncher` now sanitizes user-provided display names before printing them to
  the console.
  - Common whitespace characters such as `\t`, `\n`, `\x0B`, `\f`, and `\r` are replaced
    by a standard space character, and all other ISO control characters are emitted as a
    single dot (`.`).
* `AnnotationSupport` provides new methods for finding annotated fields and their values.
  - Consult the Javadoc for the various `findAnnotatedFields()` and
    `findAnnotatedFieldValues()` methods in `{AnnotationSupport}` for details.
* `ReflectionSupport` provides new methods for finding fields and reading a field's value.
  - Consult the Javadoc for the `findFields()` and `tryToReadFieldValue()` methods in
    `{ReflectionSupport}` for details.


[[release-notes-5.4.0-RC1-junit-jupiter]]
=== JUnit Jupiter

==== Bug Fixes

* Additional overloaded variants of the `assertEquals()` und `assertNotEquals()` methods
  in `Assertions` that solve Groovy method dispatch problems caused by overloaded variants
  introduced in 5.4 M1.
* `@RegisterExtension` fields that are `null` when evaluated are no longer silently
  ignored. Instead, the corresponding test class or test method now fails with an
  informative exception.
* `@ParameterizedTest` once again supports `MessageFormat` patterns for individual
  parameters -- for example, `+{0,number,#.##}+`.

==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* The `ParentDirProvider` strategy in the `TempDirectory` extension introduced in 5.4 M1
  now accepts a `TempDirContext` instead of `ParameterContext`.
* `@TempDir` (introduced in 5.4 M1) is no longer supported on constructor parameters.
  Please use field injection instead.

==== New Features and Improvements

* Extensions registered _programmatically_ via `@RegisterExtension` may now be registered
  in an explicit order via the `@Order` annotation.
  - See <<../user-guide/index.adoc#extensions-registration-programmatic-order, Extension
    Registration Order>> in the User Guide for details.
* New `@NullSource`, `@EmptySource`, and `@NullAndEmptySource` argument sources that
  provide `null` and _empty_ arguments to `@ParameterizedTest` methods.
  - See <<../user-guide/index.adoc#writing-tests-parameterized-tests-sources-null-and-empty,
    Null and Empty Sources>> in the User Guide for details.
* New `TestWatcher` extension API that allows extensions to process test results by
  defining result-based callbacks invoked after text execution.
  - See <<../user-guide/index.adoc#extensions-test-result-processing, Test Result
    Processing>> in the User Guide for details.
* The `TempDirectory` extension now supports parameters of type `File` in addition to
  `Path`, and `@TempDir` may now be applied to static or non-static fields.
  - See <<../user-guide/index.adoc#writing-tests-built-in-extensions-TempDirectory, The
    TempDirectory Extension>> in the User Guide for details.


[[release-notes-5.4.0-RC1-junit-vintage]]
=== JUnit Vintage

==== Bug Fixes

* The `VintageTestEngine` now uses the fully qualified class name as the _legacy reporting
  name_ for Vintage test classes instead of the simple class name which caused problems in
  test reports based on legacy reporting names -- for example, reports generated by Maven
  Surefire.

==== New Features and Improvements

* The `VintageTestEngine` now validates that the version of `junit:junit` on the classpath
  is supported (i.e., is equal to or greater than 4.12).

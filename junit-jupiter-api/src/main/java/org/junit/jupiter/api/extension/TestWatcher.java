/**
 * {@code TestWatcher} defines the API for {@link Extension Extensions} that
 * wish to process test results.
 *
 * <p>The methods in this API are called after a test has been skipped or
 * executed. Any {@link ExtensionContext.Store.CloseableResource CloseableResource}
 * objects stored in the {@link ExtensionContext.Store Store} of the supplied
 * {@link ExtensionContext} will have already been <strong>closed</strong> before
 * methods in this API are invoked.
 *
 * <p>Please note that this API is currently only used to report the results of
 * {@link org.junit.jupiter.api.Test @Test} methods and
 * {@link org.junit.jupiter.api.TestTemplate @TestTemplate} methods (e.g.,
 * {@code @RepeatedTest} and {@code @ParameterizedTest}). Moreover, if there is a
 * failure at the class level &mdash; for example, an exception thrown by a
 * {@code @BeforeAll} method &mdash; no test results will be reported.
 *
 * <p>Extensions implementing this API can be registered at any level.
 *
 * <h3>Exception Handling</h3>
 *
 * <p>In contrast to other {@link Extension} APIs, a {@code TestWatcher} is not
 * permitted to adversely influence the execution of tests. Consequently, any
 * exception thrown by a method in the {@code TestWatcher} API will be logged at
 * {@code WARNING} level and will not be allowed to propagate or fail test
 * execution.

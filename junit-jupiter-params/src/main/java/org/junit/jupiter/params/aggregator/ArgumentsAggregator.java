/**
 * {@code ArgumentsAggregator} is an abstraction for the aggregation of arguments
 * provided by an {@link org.junit.jupiter.params.provider.ArgumentsProvider
 * ArgumentsProvider} for a single invocation of a
 * {@link org.junit.jupiter.params.ParameterizedTest @ParameterizedTest} method
 * into a single object.
 *
 * <p>An {@code ArgumentsAggregator} is applied to a method parameter of a
 * {@code @ParameterizedTest} method via the {@link AggregateWith @AggregateWith}
 * annotation.
 *
 * <p>The result of the aggregation will be passed as an argument to the
 * {@code @ParameterizedTest} method for the annotated parameter.
 *
 * <p>A common use case is the aggregation of multiple columns from a single line
 * in a CSV file into a domain object such as a {@code Person}, {@code Address},
 * {@code Order}, etc.
 *
 * <p>Implementations must provide a no-args constructor and should not make any
 * assumptions regarding when they are instantiated or how often they are called.
 * Since instances may potentially be cached and called from different threads,
 * they should be thread-safe and designed to be used as singletons.
